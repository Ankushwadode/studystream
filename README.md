# PROJECT DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY

Study Stream, an E-learning web application is built with Java – Spring Boot & Agile Methodology using different frameworks involved in Java and Agile methodology concepts. Students can attend live seminars as well as video lectures. Agile methodology basically breaks up the project in different parts and to work upon each one alternately as per requirements. In Agile projects, the main project is broken into many parts/ components as per the development requirements so that each component can be constructed.

This project work upon 3 main modules i.e. Administrator module, Tutors Module and Students Module but the project is developed upon certain features integrated upon this website as they are live sessions, courses integration, chat system between tutors and students, complain panel for the students, activity log for the administrator panel.

Software development using the agile technique is flexible and iterative. In order to produce high-quality software that satisfies user needs, it promotes collaboration between the development team and stakeholders. Here is an illustration of an agile design process used to create an online learning application with the features you mentioned:
1. Define User Stories
2. Prioritize User Stories
3. Develop Iteratively
4. Continuous Testing and Feedback
5. Deploy and Maintain
6. Iterative Improvements

# APPLICATIONS

The Study Stream has the following applications:
1. E-Learning Platform:
Using the application's online classes, study guides, homework assignments, and mock exams, students will be able to acquire and hone new abilities. The platform will be handy for students to learn at their own speed because it will be accessible from anywhere.
2. Live Session Facility:
The programme will include a live session capability that enables users to communicate in real time with tutors and other users. Learning will become more interesting and participatory thanks to this feature.
3. Certification Courses:
The programme will provide certification courses that, following successful completion, will award students with a recognized certificate. Students will be able to demonstrate their abilities and expertise to potential employers in this way.
4. User-Friendly UI:
The application will feature an intuitive user interface (UI) that makes it simple for students to use and navigate. This will increase the application's use and dependability, which will appeal to students more.
5. Convenient Learning:
Students will be able to study and hone new abilities from the comfort of their homes with the aid of the application. They will have the freedom to access the courses whenever and whenever they choose and to learn at their own speed.
Overall, the initiative will provide a unique and practical method of learning while bridging the gap between students and teachers. It will provide students with a one-stop shop for improving their abilities and knowledge.

# CONCLUSION

Study Stream, a live-session-integrated e-learning platform, is a very useful instrument for offering education and training to students all over the world. It enables students to advance their abilities from the convenience of their homes thanks to its user-friendly design and wide selection of courses.

The learning process is made more dynamic and engaging by the presence of live sessions and the availability of instructor interaction. Students receive a thorough education that equips them for real-world situations through certification courses, practice exams, and projects.

The project's future potential is also enormous. The need for these platforms will only grow as more and more individuals choose online learning. This platform can stand out from the competition with the addition of more courses and features like AI-assisted learning and personalized learning paths.

Overall, this initiative has the potential to completely transform the education sector by improving accessibility, usability, and engagement. We can assist students all around the world in releasing their full potential and achieving their objectives in whichever technologies and tech stacks they are interested in by offering a seamless learning experience.
